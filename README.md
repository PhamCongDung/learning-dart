📘 Learning Dart – My Programming Foundation Journey

Welcome to my Dart learning repository!
This repo captures my entire journey of learning core programming fundamentals before moving on to Flutter development.

It contains exercises, notes, examples, mini console projects, and practice code written during my study process.

⸻

🚀 Goals of This Repository
	•	Build a strong foundation in Dart
	•	Understand fundamental programming concepts clearly
	•	Practice writing clean, structured, readable code
	•	Prepare for deeper learning: Flutter, mobile development, app architecture
	•	Document my progress day-by-day
	•	Create a transparent and consistent learning journey on GitHub

🧠 What I’m Learning Right Now
	•	Dart syntax & variables
	•	Functions & arrow functions
	•	Control flows (if/else, loops, switch)
	•	Lists, Sets, Maps
	•	OOP basics → classes, inheritance, abstraction
	•	Error handling
	•	Futures, async/await
	•	Records, pattern matching (Dart 3+)
	•	Writing console applications

🧪 Exercise Projects (Console Applications)

These small projects help me apply Dart concepts in real-world logic:      




🧭 Progress Tracking

I commit daily or whenever I complete:
	•	A concept
	•	An exercise
	•	A note
	•	A project

This helps me stay consistent and build momentum while learning.

⸻

🛠️ Tech Stack
	•	Dart SDK
	•	VS Code
	•	Git & GitHub
	•	MacBook (development environment)

✍️ Why I’m Learning Dart

I’m building the foundation required to become a Flutter developer, with the long-term goal of creating mobile apps and professional products.
A solid grasp of Dart will help me write cleaner, more maintainable code when I transition to Flutter.

⸻

📌 Next Steps
	•	Complete all advanced Dart topics
	•	Build more console apps
	•	Transition into Flutter after mastering Dart fundamentals
	•	Start creating real mobile apps and publish them on GitHub
